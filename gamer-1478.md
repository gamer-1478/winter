# Digi Chess Board

## Summary

This winter, i am planning on building a digital chess board which can track your pieces and which even you can play with solo through stockfish. 
I plan to opensource it and make sure that everyone can build theres easily, from making intuitive designs and flowcharts to readable code. 
The past month i have been a enthuisiast at the game of chess, and think DGT's monopoly on it needs to be broken and open sourced, Hence i am very excited about this opurtunity to do so. 

## Plan

First i would figure out a way to attach magnets and hall effect sensors on a real chess board. 
Then i would work on the wiring on it all and how to connect it to a raspberry pi and arduino. 
I plan to use the arudino to execute simple commands given by the pi and use the pi for stockfish or to connect to chess.com.
